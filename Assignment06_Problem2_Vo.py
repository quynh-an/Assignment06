"""
Design a base class called Shape with methods area() and perimeter() which will be overridden by
derived classes Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Each subclass should have attributes specific to the
details required to calculate the area and perimeter. Create a list of shapes and iterate over it, printing out
the area and perimeter of each shape, demonstrating polymorphism.
